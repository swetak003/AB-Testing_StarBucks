###A/B Testing – Starbucks Promotional Campaign Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of a promotional campaign using A/B testing. A randomized controlled experiment was conducted to determine whether sending a promotional offer to customers leads to a statistically significant increase in purchases and net incremental revenue compared to customers who did not receive the promotion.

The analysis applies hypothesis testing, uplift measurement, and business impact evaluation to support data-driven decision-making on campaign rollout and optimization.
Business Objective

Measure the incremental impact of a promotional offer on customer purchases

Determine whether the promotion generates positive net revenue after accounting for campaign cost

Support go / no-go decisions for scaling the promotion using statistical evidence

🧪 Experiment Design

Control Group: Customers who did not receive the promotion

Treatment Group: Customers who received the promotion

Randomization: Customers were randomly assigned to control and treatment groups

This ensures a valid experimental setup and minimizes bias.

📊 Key Metrics

Conversion Rate: Percentage of customers who made a purchase

Incremental Conversion (Uplift): Difference in conversion rates between treatment and control groups

Net Incremental Revenue: Revenue generated due to promotion minus promotion cost

🧠 Analytical Approach

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Baseline conversion comparison (control vs treatment)

Hypothesis testing using statistical methods

Confidence interval estimation for treatment effect

Business interpretation of statistical results

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

SciPy / Statsmodels – Hypothesis testing

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization

Power BI – Executive-level dashboards & storytelling

📈 Key Insights

Identified the true incremental lift attributable to the promotion

Quantified the trade-off between increased conversions and promotion cost

Provided actionable recommendations on whether the campaign should be scaled

🏦 Business Relevance

Although based on a retail use case, this project closely mirrors BFSI campaign experimentation, such as:

Credit card or loan offer testing

Customer acquisition campaigns

Promotional uplift and ROI analysis

📌 Final Recommendation

Based on statistical significance and business impact, the project provides a clear recommendation on campaign rollout supported by experimental evidence rather than intuition.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Customer segmentation–based targeting

Predictive uplift modeling

Extended analysis with Power BI dashboards
